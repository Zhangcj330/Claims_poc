Accelerated Protection is only available to person(s) receiving the PDS in Australia.\nThe information in this PDS is current as at the date of issue of this PDS. From time to time we may change or update information in this PDS.

An adviser can help you decide which Plan structure is suitable for your needs. The Plans structures available are:\n• Standalone: A claim paid under a Standalone Plan will not reduce the Benefit Amount of another Standalone Plan.\n• Attached/Attaching: When a Plan is Attached to another Plan, a claim paid under a Plan will reduce the Benefit Amount on all other Plans that it is Attached to. All Attached Plans have the same Policy Owner(s) and are issued under one Policy.\n• Linked/Linking: When a Plan is Linked to another Plan, a claim paid under a Plan will reduce the Benefit Amount on all other Plans that it is Linked to. Linked Plans have different Policy Owners and the Plans are issued under multiple policies. This allows you to package Plans that cannot be structured through superannuation with Plans that are structured through superannuation.\n• Superlink: Two policies are issued, one structured through superannuation and the other outside of superannuation. The Benefit Amount for both policies must be the same and the maximum benefit payable is the equivalent to the Benefit Amount of one Policy. This allows a portion of the premium to be funded through superannuation, thereby reducing out-of-pocket cost while still providing access to benefits that are not available when insurance is structured through superannuation.\nIf you make a claim and Superlink applies, we will assess the claim against the Policy structured through superannuation first. If a benefit is payable and the SIS legislation and rules are met, we will pay the benefits from the Policy structured through superannuation. If a benefit is payable but the SIS legislation and rules are not met, we will pay the benefits from the Policy structured outside superannuation."}

It could also be difficult for the Life Insured to attract new patients;\n•\tthe Life Insured chooses to cease performing Exposure Prone Procedures as defined by the relevant governing body; or\n•\tthe Life Insured's governing body advises the Life Insured to cease performing Exposure Prone Procedures as defined by the relevant governing body.\nIn all of these scenarios it is likely that the Life Insured's income will reduce.\nIn all these cases we will assess whether the Life Insured is Totally Unable to Work or Partially Unable to Work in accordance with the terms and conditions of their Policy.\nIf the 'to age 65' Benefit Period applies, the Blood Borne Disease Benefit will cease when the Claim Period reaches 24 months.\nWhere Income Protection is structured through superannuation (as indicated in the Policy Schedule), the Life Insured must also satisfy the SIS legislation and rules."}

Before nominating your fund for receipt of the Super Contribution Option benefit, you should check with your nominated fund that the fund rules permit receipt of the Super Contribution Option benefit.\nThe Super Contribution Option benefit should generally constitute assessable income and therefore you should keep a record of any Super Contribution Option benefit paid, to enable you to prepare your individual tax return.

If you provide the trustee of the nominated superannuation fund with a valid notice that you intend to claim a tax deduction for the personal contributions, then the trustee should treat the contributions as concessional contributions which are generally subject to tax at 15% in the superannuation fund and this tax may be deducted from your account depending on the trustee's policy. There may be different tax treatment of your Super Contribution Option benefit and taxation issues that arise depending on whether you structure your Policy through superannuation.

From 1 July 2022, there have been changes to the eligibility age for downsizer contributions and in respect of the work test for personal superannuation contributions. From 1 July 2022, the minimum age to make downsizer contributions decreased to 60 years.\nThis will allow some members aged 60 to 64 to potentially contribute $630,000 (or $1.26 million combined in the case of a couple) at one time by combining a downsizer contribution with the three-year non-concessional contributions bring-forward rule.\nIndividual members\nYou may be eligible for a tax deduction for your personal voluntary superannuation contributions.\nFrom 1 July 2022, if you are aged from 67 and 74 years, you will be able to make personal superannuation contributions without satisfying the work test, subject to existing contribution caps. However, you will still be required to meet the work test or work test exemption to claim a deduction for personal contributions. This test requires that you are gainfully employed for at least 40 hours in any consecutive 30 day period in the income year in which the contributions are made. The work test exemption applies to members aged from 67 and 74 who have a total super balance below $300,000 at the prior 30 June and meet other conditions. It is your responsibility to ensure that you satisfy the work test or work test exemption for any personal contributions that you are claiming.\nTo meet the work test exemption criteria, you must have:\n• satisfied the work test in the income year preceding the year in which you made the contribution;\n• a total super balance of less than $300,000 at the end of the previous income year; and\n• not relied on the work test exemption in a previous financial year."}

Employer and salary sacrifice contributions are also concessional contributions.\nThe concessional contributions cap for the 2022/2023 financial year is $27,500 for members of all ages. From the 2019/2020 financial year, individuals with total superannuation balances of less than $500,000 on 30 June of the previous financial year, may be able to use their unused concessional contributions cap space to increase their concessional contributions cap.\nConcessional contributions are generally included in the fund's assessable income and may be subject to tax at the rate of 15% in the fund's hands. However, where the member's personal adjusted taxable income exceeds $250,000, the ATO will issue an assessment to the member assessing all or part of their concessional contributions to an additional 15% of tax.\nWhere concessional contributions in excess of the applicable cap are made in a financial year the ATO will issue the member an assessment taxing the excess at the member's marginal tax rate (plus the Medicare levy). The member will be entitled to a tax offset equal to 15% of their excess concessional contribution (reflecting generally the tax already assessed to the recipient fund). An interest charge also applies for the deferral of tax.\nIf you are a low income earner and have eligible concessional superannuation contributions, you may be eligible for the low income superannuation tax offset, which is paid to your superannuation fund.\nThere are also limits on the amount of post-tax or 'non-concessional contributions' that can be made on behalf of a member. Personal contributions for which you do not claim an income tax deduction and any excess concessional contributions that are not refunded by the fund, are non-concessional contributions.\nFor the 2022/2023 financial year, the annual cap for non-concessional contributions is $110,000 and members with total superannuation balances of $1.7 million or more are not eligible to make non-concessional contributions. There is a 'bring-forward' option as discussed below. You will be taxed on non-concessional contributions over the cap at the rate of 45%, plus the Medicare levy where they cannot be released from a fund (and this is the case for TAL Super as stated below).\nUnder the 'bring-forward' option, generally people under 75 years of age for at least one day during the year and have not accessed this option in prior years, can make non concessional contributions of up to three times the annual cap limit (explained above) in one year (other conditions apply).\nHowever, from 1 July 2022 members with total superannuation balances of $1.48 million or more have reduced (or no) access to the bring-forward rule.\nIf you receive an excess concessional or non-concessional contribution determination from the ATO, you should not elect for amounts to be released from TAL Super. TAL Super is unable to process a release authority from the ATO because you will not have an accumulation interest in TAL Super. In these circumstances if you require an amount to be released, you should nominate another superannuation fund in which you have a sufficient accumulation interest to make the release from.\nIf your income is less than $57,016 (for the 2022/2023 financial year), you may also benefit from government co-contributions if you make a personal after tax (non-concessional) contribution to your superannuation.\nThe government co-contribution is a payment made by the Federal Government to the superannuation account of eligible members who make personal non-concessional contributions.

It is general information only and is not intended to be a comprehensive statement of the laws applying to superannuation.

Some of the key features are:\n•\tMembers can obtain Life Insurance, Total and Permanent Disability (TPD) Insurance and Income Protection through TAL Super.\n•\tTAL Super does not offer a superannuation savings facility that has an investment component. You will not receive an investment return on contributions made to your account.\n•\tMSAL will only accept contributions and rollovers to pay the premiums for insurance policies held through TAL Super.\n•\tMembership of TAL Super is for the provision of insurance benefits only.\n•\tThe Trustee may reduce your contributions if it has claimed a tax deduction for the premiums funded by the payment.\n•\tThe Trustee will only accept your application for membership of TAL Super if your application for insurance is accepted by TAL.\nThis PDS provides important information about structuring your Accelerated Protection insurance through TAL Super, the tax treatment that may apply, your options for meeting the costs of the insurance, and the potential risks of holding insurance through TAL Super. If you structure Accelerated Protection through TAL Super and pay via rollover, the cost of premiums paid will gradually reduce your superannuation over time. You should consider your retirement needs and insurance protection objectives when structuring your insurance through TAL Super.\nOnce your application has been accepted, TAL will issue a Policy to MSAL and you will be the Life Insured. You will receive a copy of the Accelerated Protection Combined PDS and Policy Document as well as the Policy Schedule. The AP Combined PDS and Policy Document contains the full terms and conditions. The Policy Schedule will list the applicable Plans and options that you've selected and any special conditions that are applicable to the Policy. You should be aware that limitations and exclusions will apply under the Policy. This means that in some cases we will not pay a claim or will pay a claim only in limited circumstances.\nYou will only be entitled to a benefit if an insured event occurs while you are covered under the Policy, and you have satisfied a condition of release under SIS. The insured events under the policies offered in TAL Super are consistent with the conditions of release. If a benefit is payable under a policy the Trustee will direct TAL to pay it to you or your beneficiaries as a superannuation benefit."}

This should include any tax implications of purchasing insurance cover structured through superannuation or outside of superannuation.\nA benefit payment will not be made under a Policy through TAL Super until the Trustee has determined to whom the benefit must be paid. This might be you, your beneficiary, your legal personal representative or one or more of your dependants. Except for benefits paid under Income Protection, benefits paid from TAL Super are treated as superannuation benefits for tax purposes. Where TAL or the Trustee is required by law to withhold any tax from a benefit, TAL or the Trustee will withhold the required amount before paying the benefit.\nIndividuals have different options to contribute to superannuation to fund the acquisition of insurance cover. Below is a general summary of the Australian tax implications of making contributions to a complying superannuation fund and receiving the types of benefits that are insured under Accelerated Protection. From 1 July 2022, there have been changes to the eligibility age for downsizer contributions and in respect of the work test for personal superannuation contributions. From 1 July 2022, the minimum age to make downsizer contributions decreased to 60 years.\nThis will allow some members aged 60 to 64 to potentially contribute $630,000 (or $1.26 million combined in the case of a couple) at one time by combining a downsizer contribution with the three-year non-concessional contributions bring-forward rule."}

However, you will still be required to meet the work test or work test exemption to claim a deduction for personal contributions. This test requires that you are gainfully employed for at least 40 hours in any consecutive 30 day period in the income year in which the contributions are made. The work test exemption applies to members aged from 67 and 74 who have a total super balance below $300,000 at the prior 30 June and meet other conditions. It is your responsibility to ensure that you satisfy the work test or work test exemption for any personal contributions that you are claiming.\nTo meet the work test exemption criteria, you must have:\n•\tsatisfied the work test in the income year preceding the year in which you made the contribution;\n•\ta total super balance of less than $300,000 at the end of the previous income year; and\n•\tnot relied on the work test exemption in a previous financial year.\nPersonal contributions which are claimed as a tax deduction are concessional contributions and are subject to the concessional contributions cap discussed below. Employer and salary sacrifice contributions are also concessional contributions.\nThe concessional contributions cap for the 2022/2023 financial year is $27,500 for members of all ages. From the 2019/2020 financial year, individuals with total superannuation balances of less than $500,000 on 30 June in the previous financial year, may be able to use their unused concessional contributions cap space to increase their concessional contributions cap.\nConcessional contributions are generally included in the fund's assessable income and may be subject to tax at the rate of 15% in the fund's hands. However, where the member's personal adjusted taxable income exceeds $250,000, the ATO will issue an assessment to the member assessing part or all of their concessional contributions to an additional 15% of tax.\nWhere concessional contributions in excess of the applicable cap are made in a financial year the ATO will issue the member an assessment taxing the excess at the member's marginal tax rate (plus the Medicare levy). The member will be entitled to a tax offset equal to 15% of their excess concessional contribution (reflecting generally the tax already assessed to the recipient fund). An interest charge also applies for the deferral of tax.\nIf you are a low income earner and have eligible concessional superannuation contributions, you may be eligible for the low income superannuation tax offset, which is paid to your superannuation fund.\nThere are also limits on the amount of post-tax or 'non-concessional contributions' that can be made on behalf of a member. Non-concessional contributions and any excess concessional contributions that are not refunded include personal contributions for which you do not claim an income tax deduction.\nFor the 2022/2023 financial year, the annual cap for non-concessional contributions is $110,000 and members with total superannuation balances of $1.7 million or more are not eligible to make non-concessional contributions. There is a 'bring-forward' option as discussed below. You will be taxed on non-concessional contributions over the cap at the rate of 45%, plus the Medicare levy where they cannot be released from a fund (and this is the case for TAL Super as stated below).\nUnder the 'bring-forward' option, generally people under 75 years of age for at least one day during the year and have not accessed this option in prior years, can make non concessional contributions of up to three times the annual cap limit (explained above) in one year (other conditions apply).\nHowever, from 1 July 2022 members with total superannuation balances of $1.48 million or more have reduced (or no) access to the bring-forward rule.\nIf you receive an excess concessional or non-concessional contribution determination from the ATO, you should not elect for amounts to be released from TAL Super. TAL Super is unable to process a release authority from the ATO because you will not have an accumulation interest in TAL Super. In these circumstances if you require an amount to be released, you should nominate another superannuation fund in which you have sufficient accumulation interest to make the release from.\nIf your income is less than $57,016 (for the 2022/2023 financial year), you may also benefit from government co-contributions if you make a personal after tax (non-concessional) contribution to your superannuation.\nThe government co-contribution is a payment made by the Federal Government to the superannuation account of eligible members who make personal non-concessional contributions.
