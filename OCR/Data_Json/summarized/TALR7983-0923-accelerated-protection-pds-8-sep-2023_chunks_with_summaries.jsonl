An adviser can help you decide which Plan structure is suitable for your needs.

All Attached Plans have the same Policy Owner(s) and are issued under one Policy.\n• Linked/Linking: When a Plan is Linked to another Plan, a claim paid under a Linked Plan will reduce the Benefit Amount on all other Plans that it is Linked to. Linked Plans have different Policy Owners and the Plans are issued under multiple policies. This allows you to package Plans that cannot be structured through superannuation with Plans that are structured through superannuation.\n• Superlink: Two policies are issued, one structured through superannuation and the other outside of superannuation. The Benefit Amount for both policies must be the same and the maximum benefit payable is the equivalent to the Benefit Amount of one Policy. This allows a portion of the premium to be funded through superannuation, thereby reducing out-of-pocket cost while still providing access to benefits that are not available when insurance is structured through superannuation.\n\nIf you make a claim and Superlink applies, we will assess the claim against the Policy structured through superannuation first.

Please refer to the 'Tax' section for more information.\nThere are some important differences between owning your insurance yourself and purchasing your insurance through superannuation. For example, some benefits will not apply where insurance is held through superannuation (as set out in this PDS). However, in some circumstances purchasing insurance through superannuation may be more advantageous.\nWhen Income Protection is structured through superannuation:\n• A claim may not be payable if you were not 'gainfully employed' (as set out in SIS) immediately before your disability started.\n• If you're not 'gainfully employed' (as set out in SIS), you can apply to have your Plan suspended for up to 12 months.\nIf you are concerned or have any questions about the potential complications of structuring Income Protection through superannuation, you should speak to your financial adviser.\nThe following information is provided to assist you in understanding your options. It is general information only and is not intended to be a comprehensive statement of the laws applying to superannuation. You should talk to a financial adviser about your personal circumstances.", "content_label": "text", "ai_summary": "You can structure your Accelerated Protection insurance through a complying superannuation fund, where the fund's trustee becomes the Policy Owner and distributes benefits according to superannuation laws. It's essential to verify if your superannuation fund can pay insurance premiums from your member account; if not, you can join TAL Super for coverage. Note that structuring insurance through superannuation may have different tax implications and benefits compared to personal ownership, particularly for Income Protection claims, which may require you to be 'gainfully employed' prior to disability. Consulting a financial adviser is recommended to navigate these complexities and understand your specific circumstances."}
