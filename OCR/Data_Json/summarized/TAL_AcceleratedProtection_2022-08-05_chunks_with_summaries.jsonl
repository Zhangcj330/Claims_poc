From 1 July 2022, if you are aged from 67 and 74 years, you will be able to make personal superannuation contributions without satisfying the work test, subject to existing contribution caps. However, you will still be required to meet the work test or work test exemption to claim a deduction for personal contributions. This test requires that you are gainfully employed for at least 40 hours in any consecutive 30 day period in the income year in which the contributions are made. The work test exemption applies to members aged from 67 and 74 who have a total super balance below $300,000 at the prior 30 June and meet other conditions. It is your responsibility to ensure that you satisfy the work test or work test exemption for any personal contributions that you are claiming. To meet the work test exemption criteria, you must have: \n• satisfied the work test in the income year preceding the year in which you made the contribution; \n• a total super balance of less than $300,000 at the end of the previous income year; and \n• not relied on the work test exemption in a previous financial year. \nPersonal contributions which are claimed as a tax deduction are concessional contributions and are subject to the concessional contributions cap discussed below. Employer and salary sacrifice contributions are also concessional contributions. The concessional contributions cap for the 2022/2023 financial year is $27,500 for members of all ages. From the 2019/2020 financial year, individuals with total superannuation balances of less than $500,000 on 30 June in the previous financial year, may be able to use their unused concessional contributions cap space to increase their concessional contributions cap. Concessional contributions are generally included in the fund’s assessable income and may be subject to tax at the rate of 15% in the fund’s hands. However, where the member’s personal adjusted taxable income exceeds $250,000, the ATO will issue an assessment to the member assessing part or all of their concessional contributions to an additional 15% of tax. Where concessional contributions in excess of the applicable cap are made in a financial year the ATO will issue the member an assessment taxing the excess at the member’s marginal tax rate (plus the Medicare levy).
