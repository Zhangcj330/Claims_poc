This should include any tax implications of purchasing insurance cover structured through superannuation or outside of superannuation.\nA benefit payment will not be made under a Policy through TAL Super until the Trustee has determined to whom the benefit must be paid.

Except for benefits paid under Income Protection, benefits paid from TAL Super are treated as superannuation benefits for tax purposes.
