·  At time of claim, you will need to provide proof of your Pre-Claim Earnings to support the Benefit Amount. If your Pre-Claim Earnings do not justify your monthly insured Benefit Amount, any benefit payable to you will be reduced. If your income has reduced since you purchased your Policy, you may want to review your Income Protection cover and/or speak to a financial adviser.
·  The Totally Unable to Work Benefit and the Partially Unable to Work Benefit only become payable after the end of the Waiting Period. The only benefits that are potentially payable for an event that occurred during the Waiting Period are the Bed Confinement Benefit and the Death Benefit.
·  The Totally Unable to Work Benefit and the Partially Unable to Work Benefit are paid monthly in arrears after the Waiting Period ends. For example, if you have a 4 week Waiting Period, the first monthly benefit will be paid to you around the end of the second month from when the Waiting Period started and monthly thereafter (unless we agree to an alternative).

An adviser can help you decide which ownership option is suitable to meet your needs. More information on tax and structuring insurance through superannuation can be found in Section 7 and Section 8. If you are structuring your Accelerated Protection insurance through TAL Super, you must also read the 'Accelerated Protection through TAL Super PDS'.

· Standalone : A claim paid under a Standalone Plan will not reduce the Benefit Amount of another Standalone Plan.
· Attached/Attaching : When a Plan is Attached to another Plan, a claim paid under a Plan will reduce the Benefit Amount on all other Plans that it is Attached to. All Attached Plans have the same Policy Owner(s) and are issued under one Policy.
· Linked/Linking : When a Plan is Linked to another Plan, a claim paid under a Plan will reduce the Benefit Amount on all other Plans that it is Linked to. Linked Plans have different Policy Owners and the Plans are issued under multiple policies. This allows you to package Plans that cannot be structured through superannuation with Plans that are structured through superannuation.
· Superlink : Two policies are issued, one structured through superannuation and the other outside of superannuation. The Benefit Amount for both policies must be the same and the maximum benefit payable is the equivalent to the Benefit Amount of one Policy. This allows a portion of the premium to be funded through superannuation, thereby reducing out-of-pocket cost while still providing access to benefits that are not available when insurance is structured through superannuation.

If you make a claim and Superlink applies, we will assess the claim against the Policy structured through superannuation first. If a benefit is payable and the SIS legislation and rules are met, we will pay the benefits from the Policy structured through superannuation. If a benefit is payable but the SIS legislation and rules are not met, we will pay the benefits from the Policy structured outside superannuation.

You should be aware of the following if you structure Accelerated Protection through superannuation:
•  You will need to be a member of the superannuation fund through which your Policy is structured.
•  The trustee of the fund owns the Policy.
·  Premiums and benefit payments are made through the fund and are subjected to restrictions under the governing rules of the fund and in accordance with superannuation law.
•  Some features of Accelerated Protection will not be available or will not apply.
·  For a claim to be paid, you must fulfil the SIS rules and regulation, and the applicable SIS definitions (refer to Section 9.2).

The cost of your Policy depends on a range of factors, including but not limited to the type of cover, your age and sex, whether you smoke, the length of time you have had your Policy and how often you choose to pay your premiums. We may also take your occupation, health, income, personal pastimes, lifestyle, the number or type of Plans you hold across one or more policies, and other factors into account in determining insurance premium amounts.
We ask for this information so that the premiums we charge take into account the different levels of risk presented by different customer groups.
Sometimes discounts may apply to certain Plans; however, these may not apply for the full term of your Policy.
Once we know a little bit about you and the cover you require, we can provide you with an indicative quote for your premium. The quoted premium may change once we have all the information we require to complete our Underwriting assessment.
All premiums are payable in advance, by the due date shown in your Policy Schedule. We will inform you of the premium payable in subsequent years before each Policy anniversary.

If you choose stepped premium, the premium is calculated based on your total Benefit Amount, the length of time you have had your Policy and your age as at each Policy anniversary. This means your premium will generally increase at each Policy anniversary. There are a range of other reasons why your stepped premium may increase, including if we change our premium rates. Please see section 1.3.2 and 1.3.3 below for more information.

Level premiums are not fixed. They can change. If you choose level premiums, the premium is based on your age at the Plan start date. Where you choose to increase your cover or the Inflation Protection Benefit applies, the premium rates used to calculate premiums for the alteration will be based on the Life Insured's age at that time. There are a range of other reasons why your level premium may increase, including if we change our premium rates. Please see sections 1.3.2 and 1.3.3  below for more information.
Where level premium 'to age 65' is shown in your Policy Schedule, premiums will change to stepped premiums on the Policy anniversary before the Life Insured's 65th birthday. Where level premium 'to age 70' is shown in your Policy Schedule, premiums will change to stepped premiums on the Policy anniversary before the Life Insured's 70th birthday.

For both stepped and level premium , your premiums and the amount you pay will change if:
·  you vary your Policy, for example when you add or remove a Plan or benefit option;
·  there is a change in your Benefit Amount, for example when your Benefit Amount increases (including through the Inflation Protection Benefit and Guaranteed Future Insurability Benefit);
·  a discount no longer applies or changes because you varied your Policy, or another policy held with us;
•  government duties or charges change; or
·  we change our premium rates or Policy fee (refer to Section 1.3.3 for details).
Premiums for your Policy may change if there are any variations to other Accelerated Protection plans or policies you hold or have cover under. This includes, but is not limited to, the following variations - increases or decreases in sums insured, addition or cancellation (including due to non-payment of premium) of other plans or policies. When determining premiums, we take into account a number of factors which may include the number or type of policies or plans that you hold or have cover under.

The cost of your cover is not guaranteed to remain the same each year. It can change for both stepped and level premium cover. In the past we have changed the premium rates used to calculate the cost of cover and Policy fees, including changing the premium rates we use to determine level premiums.
We can change our Policy fees or the premium rates we use to determine your premium. However, the premium rates we use to determine your premiums are guaranteed not to change before the first Policy anniversary.
Decisions to change premium rates or Policy fees do not occur because of changes to an individual customer's own circumstances, but rather are determined in relation to the group of customers that we insure.
We will act reasonably when making decisions to change our premium rates or Policy fees and will only make changes to the extent reasonably necessary to protect our legitimate business interests.
Our premiums and Policy fees are determined so that the total premium and Policy fees for our group of insured customers is enough to cover our expected future claims costs, meeting our associated costs of doing business and margins in providing cover to you.

We review associated factors on an ongoing basis which may include, but are by no means limited to, our assessment of regulatory or legislative requirements, our operating costs or the commercial environment. These are only some examples of factors that we may consider and others may apply.  The outcome of any premium review performed by us may result in a change to the premium rates and Policy fees we charge you. If we change the premium rates or Policy fees, you will be advised of the change to your premiums or Policy fees at least 30 days before the change takes effect.
If your premiums increase, you will always have the option to reduce the premium by reducing your cover, subject to any minimum premiums or sum insured applicable to your Policy.
You will also always have the right to cancel your cover, at any time and for any reason, including a premium increase.  There may be other options available to help you manage the cost of your cover. Please speak to us or a financial adviser for assistance.
Your Policy cannot be singled out for a change in how premium is charged because of an adverse change in the health or circumstances of the Life Insured after the Policy start date.

The Advanced Payment Benefit is an advance payment of 10% of the Benefit Amount, up to a maximum of $25,000. This benefit will be paid when the death certificate or a medical certificate confirming death of the Life Insured is provided to us.
In the first three years from the Plan start date, the Advanced Payment Benefit will only be paid if the Life Insured's death resulted from an Accident. After the first three years, the Advanced Payment Benefit will apply for all causes of death unless the cause of death is excluded.
Payment of the Advanced Payment Benefit does not mean any admission or acceptance of any claim or liability regarding current or future payments under Life Insurance.
If we pay the Advanced Payment Benefit and our assessment of the claim determines that the Death Benefit will not be paid due to breach of the duty to take reasonable care not to make a misrepresentation, we will require the Advanced Payment Benefit to be repaid to us.
If the Advanced Payment Benefit is paid, it will reduce the Benefit Amount by the amount paid under the Advanced Payment Benefit.

The purpose of the Permanent Incapacity Reset Benefit is to provide an additional support payment in the event that the Life Insured suffers Serious and Permanent Incapacity.
The Permanent Incapacity Reset Benefit is only available once the total Claim Period has reached 24 months or more for a claim.
The Permanent Incapacity Reset Benefit is payable when the Life Insured:
•  has achieved Maximum Medical Improvement of the Sickness or Injury;
•  is entitled to the Totally Unable to Work Benefit; and
•  is Seriously and Permanently Incapacitated* (see Section 9 for definition).
*Any claim for a mental illness under the Permanent Incapacity Reset Benefit will only be assessed under the 'mental illness' category under the Serious and Permanent Incapacity definition.
For the Life Insured to qualify for the Permanent Incapacity Reset Benefit on an ongoing basis, the Life Insured must continuously meet the requirements for the Permanent Incapacity Reset Benefit.

An adjustment to the Partially Unable to Work Benefit payable will be based on the Life Insured's potential Earnings. The potential Earnings is the amount that the Life Insured could reasonably earn after taking into account their capability to work. When calculating the benefit payable, we will substitute Earnings with what we consider is the Life Insured's potential Earnings.
The potential Earnings will take into consideration the Life Insured's Earnings compared to the number of hours worked, and the Life Insured's capability to work compared to their average weekly working hours in the 12 months immediately before the start of the Waiting Period. The average working hours immediately before the start of the Waiting Period will be limited to the lesser of:
•  the Life Insured's normal average weekly working hours (excluding overtime); or
•  40 hours a week.
If we adjust the benefit payment, we will act reasonably when determining the adjusted Partially Unable to Work Benefit payable.
Where we adjust the benefit payment under this clause, we will notify and explain our decision to you before we apply the adjustment.
The examples below are not real and should only be used to help you understand how we may apply an adjustment.

If a claim has been paid under the Totally Unable to Work Benefit or the Partially Unable to Work Benefit, we understand in certain circumstances the condition may reoccur from the same or a related cause during the term of the Plan. Where this happens within 12 months from the date the claim was last paid to, the reoccurrence will be considered a continuation of the initial claim. The Waiting Period will not be reapplied.
If the above applies, the Claim Period does not reset. All periods where the person qualifies for a Totally Unable to Work Benefit or Partially Unable to Work Benefit from any recurrent claims count towards the Claim Period and the Benefit Period.

If the Life Insured is a health care professional, for example a medical doctor, surgeon or dentist, and they contract a blood borne disease such as HIV, Hepatitis B or C, their ability to work can be affected by factors other than physical inability due to the illness.
The following is our approach to claims.
There are three scenarios that could affect the Life Insured. For all three scenarios the Life Insured must notify the relevant governing body of their medical condition:
·  the Life Insured chooses to disclose their condition to their patients which may lead to some of their patients seeking medical treatment elsewhere. It could also be difficult for the Life Insured to attract new patients;
·  the Life Insured chooses to cease performing Exposure Prone Procedures as defined by the relevant governing body; or
·  the Life Insured's governing body advises the Life Insured to cease performing Exposure Prone Procedures as defined by the relevant governing body.
In all of these scenarios it is likely that the Life Insured's income will reduce.
In all these cases we will assess whether the Life Insured is Totally Unable to Work or Partially Unable to Work in accordance with the terms and conditions of their Policy.

The Super Contribution Option benefit should generally constitute assessable income and therefore you should keep a record of any Super Contribution Option benefit paid, to enable you to prepare your individual tax return. If you satisfy the tests for claiming a tax deduction in respect of the personal contributions and give the trustee of the nominated superannuation fund a valid notice of intent that is acknowledged, you may be entitled to a tax deduction in respect of some or all of the personal contributions. If you provide the trustee of the nominated superannuation fund with a valid notice that you intend to claim a tax deduction for the personal contributions, then the trustee should treat the contributions as concessional contributions which are generally subject to tax at 15% in the superannuation fund and this tax may be deducted from your account depending on the trustee's policy. There may be different tax treatment of your Super Contribution Option benefit and taxation issues that arise depending on whether you structure your Policy through superannuation. These matters are your responsibility, and you may wish to seek financial and tax advice.
In order to receive this benefit, you must provide us with your instructions and any necessary information we request to make the personal contribution on your behalf.

When applying for insurance, there is a legal duty to take reasonable care not to make a misrepresentation to the insurer before the contract of insurance is entered into.
A misrepresentation is a false answer, an answer that is only partially true, or an answer which does not fairly reflect the truth.
This duty also applies when extending or making changes to existing insurance, and reinstating insurance.
If you or the Life Insured do not take reasonable care not to make a misrepresentation, there are different remedies that may be available to us. These are set out in the Insurance Contracts Act 1984 (Cth) .  These are intended to put us in the position we would have been in if the duty had been met.
For example, we may:
•  avoid the cover (treat it as if it never existed);
•  vary the amount of the cover; or
•  vary the terms of the cover.
Whether we can exercise one of these remedies depends on a number of factors, including:

--- Chunk 284 ---
Length: 540 characters, 96 words
Page: 76
Content:
·  whether you or the Life Insured took reasonable care not to make a misrepresentation. This depends on all of the relevant circumstances;
·  what we would have done if the duty had been met for example, whether we would have offered cover, and if so, on what terms;
•  whether the misrepresentation was fraudulent; and
·  in some cases, how long it has been since the cover started.
Before we exercise any of these remedies, we will explain our reasons, how to respond and provide further information, and what you can do if you disagree.

We may require you to provide this further information to us. Alternatively, we may require your authority to obtain this information from one or more third parties, for example a treating medical practitioner, your employer or accountant.
If you do not provide the information that we require, or you do not authorise us to obtain the information we require from one or more third parties, we may not be able to assess your application or provide you with a Policy or Plan.

For Income Protection, premiums paid for insuring against loss of income and for benefits which are considered assessable income, should generally be tax deductible. Benefit payments which substitute for income, or are in the nature of ordinary income, are generally considered assessable income. This should not be the case for Life Insurance, TPD Insurance, Critical Illness Insurance, Child's Critical Illness Insurance and certain benefits under Income Protection. This may vary if insurance is taken out for business purposes and you should seek professional taxation advice.

Benefits payable under the Policy that are not assessable as ordinary income may be assessed under the capital gains tax provisions if you are not the original owner of the Policy and you acquired an interest in the Policy for consideration, or you received benefit payments from the Policy and fall outside of the exemption provisions.
As noted above, benefit payments which are paid in substitute for income, or are in the nature of ordinary income, are generally considered assessable income and therefore should not also be subject to capital gains tax.

The following general information relates only to complying superannuation funds. Superannuation law and tax law are complex, so it is important to seek professional advice specific to your circumstances. From 1 July 2022, there have been changes to the eligibility age for downsizer contributions and in respect of the work test for personal superannuation contributions. From 1 July 2022, the minimum age to make downsizer contributions decreased to 60 years.
This will allow some members aged 60 to 64 to potentially contribute $630,000 (or $1.26 million combined in the case of a couple) at one time by combining a downsizer contribution with the threeyear non-concessional contributions bring-forward rule.

You may be eligible for a tax deduction for your personal voluntary superannuation contributions.
From 1 July 2022, if you are aged from 67 and 74 years, you will be able to make personal superannuation contributions without satisfying the work test, subject to existing contribution caps. However, you will still be required to meet the work test or work test exemption to claim a deduction for personal contributions. This test requires that you are gainfully employed for at least 40 hours in any consecutive 30 day period in the income year in which the contributions are made. The work test exemption applies to members aged from 67 and 74 who have a total super balance below $300,000 at the prior 30 June and meet other conditions. It is your responsibility to ensure that you satisfy the work test or work test exemption for any personal contributions that you are claiming.
To meet the work test exemption criteria, you must have:
·  satisfied the work test in the income year preceding the year in which you made the contribution;
·  a total super balance of less than $300,000 at the end of the previous income year; and
·  not relied on the work test exemption in a previous financial year.

Personal contributions which are claimed as a tax deduction are concessional contributions and are subject to the concessional contributions cap discussed below. Employer and salary sacrifice contributions are also concessional contributions.
The concessional contributions cap for the 2022/2023 financial year is $27,500 for members of all ages. From the 2019/2020 financial year, individuals with total superannuation balances of less than $500,000 on 30 June of the previous financial year, may be able to use their unused concessional contributions cap space to increase their concessional contributions cap.
Concessional contributions are generally included in the fund's assessable income and may be subject to tax at the rate of 15% in the fund's hands. However, where the member's personal adjusted taxable income exceeds $250,000, the ATO will issue an assessment to the member assessing all or part of their concessional contributions to an additional 15% of tax.

--- Chunk 303 ---
Length: 953 characters, 152 words

Content:
Where concessional contributions in excess of the applicable cap are made in a financial year the ATO will issue the member an assessment taxing the excess at the member's marginal tax rate (plus the Medicare levy). The member will be entitled to a tax offset equal to 15% of their excess concessional contribution (reflecting generally the tax already assessed to the recipient fund). An interest charge also applies for the deferral of tax.
If you are a low income earner and have eligible concessional superannuation contributions, you may be eligible for the low income superannuation tax offset, which is paid to your superannuation fund.
There are also limits on the amount of post-tax or 'nonconcessional contributions' that can be made on behalf of a member. Personal contributions for which you do not claim an income tax deduction and any excess concessional contributions that are not refunded by the fund, are non-concessional contributions.

For the 2022/2023 financial year, the annual cap for non-concessional contributions is $110,000 and members with total superannuation balances of $1.7 million or more are not eligible to make nonconcessional contributions. There is a 'bring-forward' option as discussed below. You will be taxed on nonconcessional contributions over the cap at the rate of 45%, plus the Medicare levy where they cannot be released from a fund (and this is the case for TAL Super as stated below).
Under the 'bring-forward' option, generally people under 75 years of age for at least one day during the year and have not accessed this option in prior years, can make non concessional contributions of up to three times the annual cap limit (explained above) in one year (other conditions apply).
However, from 1 July 2022 members with total superannuation balances of $1.48 million or more have reduced (or no) access to the bring-forward rule.

If you receive an excess concessional or nonconcessional contribution determination from the ATO, you should not elect for amounts to be released from TAL Super. TAL Super is unable to process a release authority from the ATO because you will not have an accumulation interest in TAL Super. In these circumstances if you require an amount to be released, you should nominate another superannuation fund in which you have a sufficient accumulation interest to make the release from.
If your income is less than $57,016 (for the 2022/2023 financial year), you may also benefit from government co-contributions if you make a personal after tax (nonconcessional) contribution to your superannuation.
The government co-contribution is a payment made by the Federal Government to the superannuation account of eligible members who make personal nonconcessional contributions. For more information contact your financial adviser or the Australian Tax Office (ATO) Superannuation Infoline on 13 10 20.

Lump sum death benefits are tax free if paid to a dependant for tax purposes or the member's estate where the beneficiaries of the estate are dependants of the member for tax purposes. Lump sum death benefits paid to non-dependants for tax purposes or the member's estate to the extent the beneficiaries are not dependants for tax purposes, are taxed at different rates depending on whether the elements are from taxed or untaxed sources. For elements taxed in the fund, the rate is the lower of the recipient's marginal tax rate and 15%, plus the Medicare levy. For elements untaxed in the fund, the rate is the lower of the recipient's marginal tax rate and 30%, plus the Medicare levy. The trustee of the member's estate does not bear the Medicare levy.

Where TAL or the trustee is required by law to deduct any tax, duty, impost or the like in connection with the payment of a benefit, TAL or the trustee will deduct the required amount from the payment and forward it to the relevant authority. For example, we will withhold tax from the Income Protection benefits that are in the nature of income (including the Super Contribution Option benefit), before the amounts are paid by us to the member or their nominated superannuation fund. This withholding tax arrangement applies for policies structured through TAL Super or certain retail superannuation funds. In other cases, the Policy Owner needs to consider the income and withholding tax implications upon receiving the Income Protection benefits and allocating the Super Contribution Option benefit to a nominated superannuation fund. We will also withhold tax from TPD and death benefits where required by law.

When benefits are paid, they will be received by the trustee who will then distribute them in accordance with the governing rules of the superannuation fund and superannuation law.
Check with the trustee of your superannuation fund to see whether they can pay TAL your insurance premiums from your member account. This would be the case for most self-managed superannuation funds.
If you are not a member of a complying superannuation fund, or you are a member of a fund which cannot pay us insurance premiums from your member account, you can still take out Accelerated Protection through superannuation by becoming a member of TAL Super (see Accelerated Protection through TAL Super PDS). This applies to Life Insurance, TPD Insurance and Income Protection.
If you structure your Accelerated Protection through superannuation the taxation impacts may differ from holding insurance outside of superannuation, so it's important to seek financial and taxation advice before you make this decision. Superannuation law is complex, so this advice should be specific to your circumstances. Please refer to the 'Tax' section for more information.

There are some important differences between owning your insurance yourself and purchasing your insurance through superannuation. For example, some benefits will not apply where insurance is held through superannuation (as set out in this PDS). However, in some circumstances purchasing insurance through superannuation may be more advantageous.
When Income Protection is structured through superannuation:
·  A claim may not be payable if you were not 'gainfully employed' (as set out in SIS) immediately before your disability started.
·  If you're not 'gainfully employed' (as set out in SIS), you can apply to have your Plan suspended for up to 12 months.
If you are concerned or have any questions about the potential complications of structuring Income Protection through superannuation, you should speak to your financial adviser.
The following information is provided to assist you in understanding your options. It is general information only and is not intended to be a comprehensive statement of the laws applying to superannuation. You should talk to a financial adviser about your personal circumstances.

•  The member's legal representative.
·  Any person who was financially dependent on the member at the time of death.

There are risks you should consider before deciding to hold insurance through superannuation, including:
·  Except for Income Protection benefits, a benefit paid from a policy structured through superannuation is a superannuation benefit for tax purposes and it may be subject to more tax than would otherwise apply if the benefit was paid from the same insurance held outside of superannuation.
·  Limits apply to the amount you can contribute to superannuation each year. Any contributions you make to a superannuation fund in order to pay premiums will reduce the amount you may be able to contribute to other superannuation accounts you hold for retirement savings purposes.
·  Where you choose to pay premiums by rollover from another superannuation fund, your retirement savings will be reduced so that you may have less available to you on retirement than otherwise may have been the case. You should ensure that the cost of premiums do not inappropriately erode your retirement savings.
·  Taxation or superannuation laws may change in the future, altering the suitability of holding insurance through superannuation.

The following information is provided to assist you in understanding your membership in TAL Super. It is general information only and is not intended to be a comprehensive statement of the laws applying to superannuation. You should talk to your financial adviser about your personal circumstances.
TAL Super provides members with insurance benefits within superannuation. Some of the key features are:
You will only be entitled to a benefit if an insured event occurs while you are covered under the Policy, and you have satisfied a condition of release under SIS. The insured events under the policies offered in TAL Super are consistent with the conditions of release. If a benefit is payable under a policy the Trustee will direct TAL to pay it to you or your beneficiaries as a superannuation benefit.

·  Members can obtain Life Insurance, Total and Permanent Disability (TPD) Insurance and Income Protection through TAL Super.
·  TAL Super does not offer a superannuation savings facility that has an investment component.  You will not receive an investment return on contributions made to your account.
·  MSAL will only accept contributions and rollovers to pay the premiums for insurance policies held through TAL Super.
·  Membership of TAL Super is for the provision of insurance benefits only.
·  The Trustee may reduce your contributions if it has claimed a tax deduction for the premiums funded by the payment.
·  The Trustee will only accept your application for membership of TAL Super if your application for insurance is accepted by TAL.
This PDS provides important information about structuring your Accelerated Protection insurance through TAL Super, the tax treatment that may apply, your options for meeting the costs of the insurance, and the potential risks of holding insurance through TAL Super. If you structure Accelerated Protection through TAL Super and pay via rollover, the cost of premiums paid will gradually reduce your superannuation over time. You should consider your retirement needs and insurance protection objectives when structuring your insurance through TAL Super.

The Policy Schedule will list the applicable Plans and options that you've selected and any special conditions that are applicable to the Policy. You should be aware that limitations and exclusions will apply under the Policy. This means that in some cases we will not pay a claim or will pay a claim only in limited circumstances.

If you change your mind about purchasing insurance with us within 30 days of the date we issue your Policy, you can cancel the Policy and the Trustee will receive a full refund. However, your refund may be subject to superannuation preservation rules. So instead of a cash payment, your refund may be returned to the trustee of the superannuation fund from which the premium originally came. This only applies if you haven't made a claim. To receive your refund, simply provide us with a written signed request to cancel the Policy within the 30 days. And you don't have to tell us why you've changed your mind.
If you nominate a superannuation arrangement that does not accept the premium refund, the Trustee can only pay the refund to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO).

Contributions can only be made to TAL Super in accordance with superannuation law. Superannuation law stipulates the way in which employer and personal contributions can be made as well as work requirements and age limits in relation to the acceptance of superannuation contributions for members.
Please note that the Trustee only accepts contributions to pay for insurance premiums. In circumstances agreed by the Trustee and TAL, an overpayment of premium may be held and applied to reduce future premiums. You will not receive interest or an investment return on contributions made.

There are risks you should consider before deciding to hold insurance through superannuation, including:
·  Except for Income Protection benefits, a benefit paid from TAL Super is a superannuation benefit for tax purposes and it may be subject to more tax than would otherwise apply if the benefit was paid from the same insurance held outside of superannuation.
·  Limits apply to the amount you can contribute to superannuation each year.
·  Where you choose to pay premiums by rollover from another superannuation fund, your retirement savings will be reduced so that you will have less available to you on retirement than otherwise would have been the case.
·  Taxation or SIS laws may change in the future, altering the suitability of holding insurance in superannuation.
·  Any contributions you make to TAL Super in order to pay premiums will reduce the amount you may be able to contribute to other superannuation accounts you hold for retirement savings purposes.

When you structure Accelerated Protection through TAL Super, your Policy is owned by the Trustee under TAL Super in the Mercer Super Trust.  The Mercer Super Trust is a regulated superannuation fund regulated by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) under the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 (Cth) . Mercer pays for the Trustee's costs of running TAL Super. TAL makes payments to Mercer towards the costs of running TAL Super. These costs are not an additional cost to you.
Once you are a member of TAL Super and TAL has agreed to issue the cover, the Trustee will be the Policy Owner and you will then be the Life Insured. You will not have an accumulation account in TAL Super, as the Trustee will immediately pay all contributions and rollovers received for you to the Mercer Super Trust (TAL Super) Application Moneys Account to pay your Accelerated Protection insurance premiums. Your membership of TAL Super only provides insurance benefits.
TAL Super is governed by the Trust Deed. The Trustee can amend these governing rules at any time if superannuation law permits.

The insurance products available through TAL Super are Life Insurance, Total and Permanent Disability (TPD) Insurance, and Income Protection (IP) Insurance Plans as set out in the Accelerated Protection Combined PDS and Policy Document. You should read the Accelerated Protection Combined PDS and Policy Document carefully as it sets out important information about:
•  eligibility for insurance cover;
•  various ways to structure your insurance cover;
·  your duty to take reasonable care not to make a misrepresentation when completing an application for insurance;
·  insurance benefit provided including when cover starts and ends and maximum insured amounts;
•  the cost of cover including any discounts available;
•  how to make a claim for a benefit;
·  the terms and conditions of those benefits, including important definitions; and
·  exclusions and restrictions on the payment of those benefits.
The Trustee may reduce your contributions if it is able to claim a tax deduction for the premiums funded by that payment and the contributions are not assessable income to the fund. To reflect the most common tax outcome to TAL Super, the Trustee will assume:

--- Chunk 431 ---
Length: 709 characters, 127 words
Page: 115
Content:
·  you will be claiming a tax deduction for any personal contributions you make. This means we will assume that 15% tax will be payable on the contribution and the premium funded by your contribution will be deductible, resulting in no net tax impact for TAL Super; and
·  any rollover you make is non-taxable, meaning that no tax is payable on the rollover, but the premium funded by the rollover is deductible to TAL Super for tax purposes, so there will be a net 15% tax impact; i.e. your rollover will only need to fund 85% of the premium.
It's not possible to later adjust those outcomes to reflect your individual tax circumstances. These outcomes do not change the premiums paid or the amount of cover.

·  child of the member of any age (including adopted child, stepchild and ex-nuptial child);
•  the member's legal personal representative;
·  any person who was financially dependent on the member at the time of death; and
·  any person with whom the member had an interdependency relationship.
Where after reasonable searches the Trustee cannot locate any of these persons, it may pay the death benefit to an individual non-dependant such as a parent or sibling.

Other than death benefits, a superannuation benefit can only be paid where the member meets a condition of release under SIS. Generally, these circumstances include permanent incapacity, temporary incapacity, terminal medical condition, retirement (or the person has reached their preservation age), the termination of employment after age 60, leaving Australia after holding an eligible temporary resident visa, and on financial hardship or compassionate grounds. Rules relating to when superannuation benefits can be accessed are complex, so you should consult your financial adviser for further information.
Please note that not all the above conditions are relevant to your membership in TAL Super. You will only receive a benefit from TAL Super for one of the following conditions of release:
•  death;
•  permanent incapacity;
•  temporary incapacity; or
•  terminal medical condition.

Understanding who receives your superannuation and insurance benefit in the event of your death is important. Under the Trust Deed, the Trustee has the discretion to determine to whom and in what proportions any death benefit is payable (see below for binding nominations). You may nominate your legal personal representative and/or dependants as your preferred beneficiaries and the Trustee will consider your wishes in the event of your death.
In the event of your death, benefits will be paid to one or more of your dependants or to your legal personal representative as determined by the Trustee.
For superannuation and tax purposes, the definition of 'dependant' includes any of the following:

·  A child of the member, including adopted child, stepchild, ex-nuptial child or child of the member's spouse (but for tax purposes a child must be under age 18);
·  A person who is financially dependent on the member; or

Generally, your nomination is only a guide. The Trustee is obliged to pay your death benefit in accordance with the Trust Deed and superannuation laws. If you wish to make your nomination binding, the Trust Deed and superannuation laws require special conditions to be met.
When making (or amending) a binding nomination, the nomination must be signed in the presence of two witnesses. Both witnesses need to be over the age of 18 and cannot be beneficiaries under the binding nomination.
Each binding nomination remains valid for only three years. If you choose this option, it is your responsibility to renew your nomination and advise the Trustee of appropriate changes.
If your nomination expires or is invalid at the time of your death, the Trustee has the discretion to determine to whom and in what proportions any death benefit is payable.

The cost of insurance is referred to as the premium and is determined by TAL. The cost of your Policy depends on a range of factors, including but not limited to the type of cover, your age and gender, whether or not you smoke, the length of time you have had your Policy and how often you choose to pay your premiums. We may also take your occupation, health, income, personal pastimes, lifestyle and other factors into account in determining insurance premium amounts.
We ask for this information so that the premiums we charge take into account the different levels of risk presented by different customer groups. Sometimes discounts may apply to certain Plans; however, these may not apply for the full term of your Policy.
Once we know a little bit about you and the cover you require, we can provide you with an indicative quote for your premium. The quoted premium may change once we have all the information we require to complete our Underwriting assessment.
All premiums (monthly, half-yearly, quarterly and annually) are payable in advance, by the due date shown in your Policy Schedule. We will inform you of the premium payable in subsequent years before each Policy anniversary.

The cost of your cover is not guaranteed to remain the same each year. It can change for both stepped and level premium cover. In the past we have changed the premium rates used to calculate the cost of cover and Policy fees, including changing the premium rates we use to determine level premiums.
We can change our Policy fees or the premium rates we use to determine your premium. However, the premium rates we use to determine your premiums are guaranteed not to change before the first Policy anniversary.
Decisions to change premium rates or Policy fees do not occur because of changes to an individual customer's own circumstances, but rather are determined in relation to the group of customers that we insure.
We will act reasonably when making decisions to change our premium rates or Policy fees and will only make changes to the extent reasonably necessary to protect our legitimate business interests.
Our premiums and Policy fees are determined so that the total premium and Policy fees for our group of insured customers is sufficient to cover our expected future claims costs, meeting our associated costs of doing business and margins in providing cover to you.

We review associated factors on an ongoing basis which may include, but are by no means limited to, our assessment of regulatory or legislative requirements, our operating costs or the commercial environment. These are only some examples of factors that we may consider, and others may apply.  The outcome of any premium review performed by us may result in a change to the premium rates and Policy fees we charge you. If we change the premium rates or Policy fees, you will be advised of the change to your premiums or Policy fees at least 30 days before the change takes effect.
If your premiums increase, you will always have the option to reduce the premium by reducing your cover, subject to any minimum premiums or sum insured applicable to your Policy.
You will also always have the right to cancel your cover, at any time and for any reason, including a premium increase.  There may be other options available to help you manage the cost of your cover. Please speak to your adviser for assistance.

Unless otherwise stated, the general information provided below is based on Australian law that is in force at the time this document was prepared and relates to Australian resident individuals only.
We recommend that you obtain independent, professional tax advice that takes into account your specific circumstances regarding the tax and superannuation implications of investing in or contributing to superannuation and of joining and obtaining insurance cover through TAL Super.
The complexity of taxation laws and rulings is such that any advice should be specific to your circumstances. This should include any tax implications of purchasing insurance cover structured through superannuation or outside of superannuation.
A benefit payment will not be made under a Policy through TAL Super until the Trustee has determined to whom the benefit must be paid. This might be you, your beneficiary, your legal personal representative or one or more of your dependants. Except for benefits paid under Income Protection, benefits paid from TAL Super are treated as superannuation benefits for tax purposes. Where TAL or the Trustee is required by law to withhold any tax from a benefit, TAL or the Trustee will withhold the required amount before paying the benefit.

Individuals have different options to contribute to superannuation to fund the acquisition of insurance cover. Below is a general summary of the Australian tax implications of making contributions to a complying superannuation fund and receiving the types of benefits that are insured under Accelerated Protection. From 1 July 2022, there have been changes to the eligibility age for downsizer contributions and in respect of the work test for personal superannuation contributions. From 1 July 2022, the minimum age to make downsizer contributions decreased to 60 years.
This will allow some members aged 60 to 64 to potentially contribute $630,000 (or $1.26 million combined in the case of a couple) at one time by combining a downsizer contribution with the three-year non-concessional contributions bring-forward rule.

You may be eligible for a tax deduction for your personal voluntary superannuation contributions.
From 1 July 2022, if you are aged from 67 and 74 years, you will be able to make personal superannuation contributions without satisfying the work test, subject to existing contribution caps. However, you will still be required to meet the work test or work test exemption to claim a deduction for personal contributions. This test requires that you are gainfully employed for at least 40 hours in any consecutive 30 day period in the income year in which the contributions are made. The work test exemption applies to members aged from 67 and 74 who have a total super balance below $300,000 at the prior 30 June and meet other conditions. It is your responsibility to ensure that you satisfy the work test or work test exemption for any personal contributions that you are claiming.
To meet the work test exemption criteria, you must have:
·  satisfied the work test in the income year preceding the year in which you made the contribution;
·  a total super balance of less than $300,000 at the end of the previous income year; and
·  not relied on the work test exemption in a previous financial year.

Personal contributions which are claimed as a tax deduction are concessional contributions and are subject to the concessional contributions cap discussed below. Employer and salary sacrifice contributions are also concessional contributions.
The concessional contributions cap for the 2022/2023 financial year is $27,500 for members of all ages. From the 2019/2020 financial year, individuals with total superannuation balances of less than $500,000 on 30 June in the previous financial year, may be able to use their unused concessional contributions cap space to increase their concessional contributions cap.
Concessional contributions are generally included in the fund's assessable income and may be subject to tax at the rate of 15% in the fund's hands. However, where the member's personal adjusted taxable income exceeds $250,000, the ATO will issue an assessment to the member assessing part or all of their concessional contributions to an additional 15% of tax.

--- Chunk 455 ---
Length: 945 characters, 149 words
Page: 120
Content:
Where concessional contributions in excess of the applicable cap are made in a financial year the ATO will issue the member an assessment taxing the excess at the member's marginal tax rate (plus the Medicare levy). The member will be entitled to a tax offset equal to 15% of their excess concessional contribution (reflecting generally the tax already assessed to the recipient fund). An interest charge also applies for the deferral of tax.
If you are a low income earner and have eligible concessional superannuation contributions, you may be eligible for the low income superannuation tax offset, which is paid to your superannuation fund.
There are also limits on the amount of post-tax or 'non-concessional contributions' that can be made on behalf of a member. Non-concessional contributions and any excess concessional contributions that are not refunded include personal contributions for which you do not claim an income tax deduction.

For the 2022/2023 financial year, the annual cap for non-concessional contributions is $110,000 and members with total superannuation balances of $1.7 million or more are not eligible to make nonconcessional contributions. There is a 'bring-forward' option as discussed below. You will be taxed on nonconcessional contributions over the cap at the rate of 45%, plus the Medicare levy where they cannot be released from a fund (and this is the case for TAL Super as stated below).
Under the 'bring-forward' option, generally people under 75 years of age for at least one day during the year and have not accessed this option in prior years, can make non concessional contributions of up to three times the annual cap limit (explained above) in one year (other conditions apply).
However, from 1 July 2022 members with total superannuation balances of $1.48 million or more have reduced (or no) access to the bring-forward rule.

If you receive an excess concessional or nonconcessional contribution determination from the ATO, you should not elect for amounts to be released from TAL Super. TAL Super is unable to process a release authority from the ATO because you will not have an accumulation interest in TAL Super. In these circumstances if you require an amount to be released, you should nominate another superannuation fund in which you have sufficient accumulation interest to make the release from.
If your income is less than $57,016 (for the 2022/2023 financial year), you may also benefit from government co-contributions if you make a personal after tax (nonconcessional) contribution to your superannuation.
The government co-contribution is a payment made by the Federal Government to the superannuation account of eligible members who make personal nonconcessional contributions. For more information contact your financial adviser or the Australian Tax Office (ATO) Superannuation Infoline on 13 10 20.

Employer contributions are tax deductible to the employer where they are made to provide superannuation benefits for an employee or the employee's dependants.
Employers can make contributions to complying superannuation funds for employees aged:
•  under 75; or
·  75 and over, where contributions are required under legislation (such as the Superannuation Guarantee) or by relevant industrial awards.

Lump sum death benefits are tax free if paid to a dependant for tax purposes or the member's estate where the beneficiaries of the estate are dependants of the member for tax purposes. Lump sum death benefits paid to non-dependants for tax purposes or the member's estate to the extent the beneficiaries are not dependants for tax purposes, are taxed at different rates depending on whether the elements are from taxed or untaxed sources. For elements taxed in the fund, the rate is the lower of the recipient's marginal tax rate and 15%, plus the Medicare levy. For elements untaxed in the fund, the rate is the lower of the recipient's marginal tax rate and 30%, plus the Medicare levy. The trustee of the member's estate does not bear the Medicare levy.

Where TAL or the Trustee is required by law to deduct any tax, duty, impost or the like in connection with the payment of a benefit, TAL or the Trustee will deduct the required amount from the payment and forward it to the relevant authority. For example, TAL will withhold tax from the Income Protection benefits that are income in nature and the Super Contribution Benefit before the amounts are paid to the member or their nominated superannuation fund respectively, as required by the tax law. TAL will also withhold tax from TPD and death benefits where required by law.
