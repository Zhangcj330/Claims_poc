· Standalone : A claim paid under a Standalone Plan will not reduce the Benefit Amount of another Standalone Plan.
· Attached/Attaching : When a Plan is Attached to another Plan, a claim paid under a Plan will reduce the Benefit Amount on all other Plans that it is Attached to. All Attached Plans have the same Policy Owner(s) and are issued under one Policy.
· Linked/Linking : When a Plan is Linked to another Plan, a claim paid under a Plan will reduce the Benefit Amount on all other Plans that it is Linked to. Linked Plans have different Policy Owners and the Plans are issued under multiple policies. This allows you to package Plans that cannot be structured through superannuation with Plans that are structured through superannuation.
· Superlink : Two policies are issued, one structured through superannuation and the other outside of superannuation. The Benefit Amount for both policies must be the same and the maximum benefit payable is the equivalent to the Benefit Amount of one Policy. This allows a portion of the premium to be funded through superannuation, thereby reducing out-of-pocket cost while still providing access to benefits that are not available when insurance is structured through superannuation.

The cost of your cover is not guaranteed to remain the same each year. It can change for both stepped and level premium cover. In the past we have changed the premium rates used to calculate the cost of cover and Policy fees, including changing the premium rates we use to determine level premiums.
We can change our Policy fees or the premium rates we use to determine your premium. If we do this, the cost of your cover will change. However, the premium rates we use to determine your premiums are guaranteed not to change before the first Policy anniversary.
Decisions to change premium rates or Policy fees do not occur because of changes to an individual customer's own circumstances, but rather are determined in relation to the group of customers that we insure.
We will act reasonably when making decisions to change our premium rates or Policy fees and will only make changes to the extent reasonably necessary to protect our legitimate business interests.
Our premiums and Policy fees are determined so that the total premium and Policy fees for our group of insured customers is enough to cover our expected future claims costs, meeting our associated costs of doing business and margins in providing cover to you.

If your premiums increase, you will always have the option to reduce the premium by reducing your cover, subject to any minimum premiums or sum insured applicable to your Policy.
You will also always have the right to cancel your cover, at any time and for any reason, including a premium increase.  There may be other options available to help you manage the cost of your cover. Please speak to us or a financial adviser for assistance.

The Advanced Payment Benefit is an advance payment of 10% of the Benefit Amount, up to a maximum of $25,000. This benefit will be paid when the death certificate or a medical certificate confirming death of the Life Insured is provided to us.
In the first three years from the Plan start date, the Advanced Payment Benefit will only be paid if the Life Insured's death resulted from an Accident. After the first three years, the Advanced Payment Benefit will apply for all causes of death unless the cause of death is excluded.
Payment of the Advanced Payment Benefit does not mean any admission or acceptance of any claim or liability regarding current or future payments under Life Insurance.
If we pay the Advanced Payment Benefit and our assessment of the claim determines that the Death Benefit will not be paid due to breach of the duty to take reasonable care not to make a misrepresentation, we will require the Advanced Payment Benefit to be repaid to us.
If the Advanced Payment Benefit is paid, it will reduce the Benefit Amount by the amount paid under the Advanced Payment Benefit.

An adjustment to the Partially Unable to Work Benefit payable will be based on the Life Insured's potential Earnings. The potential Earnings is the amount that the Life Insured could reasonably earn after taking into account their capability to work. When calculating the benefit payable, we will substitute Earnings with what we consider is the Life Insured's potential Earnings.
The potential Earnings will take into consideration the Life Insured's Earnings compared to the number of hours worked, and the Life Insured's capability to work compared to their average weekly working hours in the 12 months immediately before the start of the Waiting Period. The average working hours immediately before the start of the Waiting Period will be limited to the lesser of:

If the Life Insured is a health care professional, for example a medical doctor, surgeon or dentist, and they contract a blood borne disease such as HIV, Hepatitis B or C, their ability to work can be affected by factors other than physical inability due to the illness.
The following is our approach to claims.
There are three scenarios that could affect the Life Insured. For all three scenarios the Life Insured must notify the relevant governing body of their medical condition:
the Life Insured chooses to disclose their condition · to their patients which may lead to some of their patients seeking medical treatment elsewhere. It could also be difficult for the Life Insured to attract new patients;
the Life Insured chooses to cease performing · Exposure Prone Procedures as defined by the relevant governing body; or
the Life Insured's governing body advises the · Life Insured to cease performing Exposure Prone Procedures as defined by the relevant governing body.
In all of these scenarios it is likely that the Life Insured's income will reduce.
In all these cases we will assess whether the Life Insured is Totally Unable to Work or Partially Unable to Work in accordance with the terms and conditions of their Policy.

When applying for insurance, there is a legal duty to take reasonable care not to make a misrepresentation to the insurer before the contract of insurance is entered into.
A misrepresentation is a false answer, an answer that is only partially true, or an answer which does not fairly reflect the truth.
This duty also applies when extending or making changes to existing insurance, and reinstating insurance.
If you or the Life Insured do not take reasonable care not to make a misrepresentation, there are different remedies that may be available to us. These are set out in the Insurance Contracts Act 1984 (Cth) .  These are intended to put us in the position we would have been in if the duty had been met.
For example, we may:
avoid the cover (treat it as if it never existed); ·
vary the amount of the cover; or ·
vary the terms of the cover. ·
Whether we can exercise one of these remedies depends on a number of factors, including:

Alternatively, we may require an authority to obtain this information from one or more third parties, for example a treating medical practitioner, employer or accountant.

For Income Protection, premiums paid for insuring against loss of income and for benefits which are considered assessable income, should generally be tax deductible.

You can make concessional or non-concessional superannuation contributions to a complying superannuation fund. Non-concessional contributions include contributions for which you do not claim an income tax deduction and any excess concessional contributions that are not refunded by the fund.
Concessional contributions include personal contributions which are claimed as a tax deduction, employer contributions and salary sacrifice contributions.
Concessional contributions are generally included in the fund's assessable income and may be subject to tax at the rate of 15% in the fund's hands. Additional taxes may be imposed on a member with a high adjusted taxable income above $250,000 that receives concessional contributions.
There are caps on the amount you can contribute to your superannuation each financial year to be taxed at lower rates, one for concessional contributions and another one that applies to non-concessional contributions. These caps exist to limit the amount that you can contribute to your superannuation each financial year and still receive concessional tax treatment. If your contributions exceed these caps, you may have to pay extra tax.

If you receive an excess concessional or nonconcessional contribution determination from the ATO, you should not elect for amounts to be released from TAL Super. TAL Super is unable to process a release authority from the ATO because you will not have an accumulation interest in TAL Super. In these circumstances if you require an amount to be released, you should nominate another superannuation fund in which you have a sufficient account balance to make the release from.
Depending on your income you may also benefit from government co-contributions if you make a nonconcessional contribution to your superannuation. The government co-contribution is a payment made by the Federal Government to the superannuation account of eligible members who make non-concessional contributions.
For more information about contributions, including the caps that apply each year and how contributions are counted towards the caps, as well as how government co-contributions work, please contact your financial adviser or go to www.ato.gov.au .

Where TAL or the trustee is required by law to deduct any tax, duty, impost or the like in connection with the payment of a benefit, TAL or the trustee will deduct the required amount from the payment and forward it to the relevant authority.

This withholding tax arrangement applies for policies structured through TAL Super or certain retail superannuation funds. In other cases, the Policy Owner needs to consider the income and withholding tax implications upon receiving the Income Protection benefits and allocating the Super Contribution Option benefit to a nominated superannuation fund.

When benefits are paid, they will be received by the trustee who will then distribute them in accordance with the governing rules of the superannuation fund and superannuation law.
Check with the trustee of your superannuation fund to see whether they can pay TAL your insurance premiums from your member account. This would be the case for most self-managed superannuation funds.
If you are not a member of a complying superannuation fund, or you are a member of a fund which cannot pay us insurance premiums from your member account, you can still take out Accelerated Protection through superannuation by becoming a member of TAL Super (see Accelerated Protection through TAL Super PDS). This applies to Life Insurance, TPD Insurance and Income Protection.
If you structure your Accelerated Protection through superannuation the taxation impacts may differ from holding insurance outside of superannuation, so it's important to seek financial and taxation advice before you make this decision. Superannuation law is complex, so this advice should be specific to your circumstances. Please refer to the 'Tax' section for more information.

There are some important differences between owning your insurance yourself and purchasing your insurance through superannuation. For example, some benefits will not apply where insurance is held through superannuation (as set out in this PDS). However, in some circumstances purchasing insurance through superannuation may be more advantageous.
When Income Protection is structured through superannuation:
A claim may not be payable if you were not 'gainfully · employed' (as set out in SIS) immediately before your disability started.
If you're not 'gainfully employed' (as set out in SIS), · you can apply to have your Plan suspended for up to 12 months.
If you are concerned or have any questions about the potential complications of structuring Income Protection through superannuation, you should speak to your financial adviser.
The following information is provided to assist you in understanding your options. It is general information only and is not intended to be a comprehensive statement of the laws applying to superannuation. You should talk to a financial adviser about your personal circumstances.

There are risks you should consider before deciding to hold insurance through superannuation, including:
Except for Income Protection benefits, a benefit paid · from a policy structured through superannuation is a superannuation benefit for tax purposes and it may be subject to more tax than would otherwise apply if the benefit was paid from the same insurance held outside of superannuation.
Limits apply to the amount you can contribute to · superannuation each year. Any contributions you make to a superannuation fund in order to pay premiums will reduce the amount you may be able to contribute to other superannuation accounts you hold for retirement savings purposes.
Where you choose to pay premiums by rollover · from another superannuation fund, your retirement savings will be reduced so that you may have less available to you on retirement than otherwise may have been the case. You should ensure that the cost of premiums do not inappropriately erode your retirement savings.
Taxation or superannuation laws may change in the · future, altering the suitability of holding insurance through superannuation.

exclusions and restrictions on the payment of those · benefits.
The Trustee may reduce your contributions if it is able to claim a tax deduction for the premiums funded by that payment and the contributions are not assessable income to the fund. To reflect the most common tax outcome to TAL Super, the Trustee will assume:

Content:
you will be claiming a tax deduction for any personal · contributions you make. This means we will assume that 15% tax will be payable on the contribution and the premium funded by your contribution will be deductible, resulting in no net tax impact for TAL Super; and
any rollover you make is non-taxable, meaning that · no tax is payable on the rollover, but the premium funded by the rollover is deductible to TAL Super for tax purposes, so there will be a net 15% tax impact; i.e. your rollover will only need to fund 85% of the premium.
It's not possible to later adjust those outcomes to reflect your individual tax circumstances. These outcomes do not change the premiums paid or the amount of cover.

Provisions in the Family Law Act enable parties who are married or in a de-facto relationship to require superannuation fund trustees to carry out certain actions in relation to superannuation entitlements. Members should note that their spouse or de-facto will be able to request the trustee to disclose information about the member's benefit entitlements ('Request for Information').
The trustee is prohibited by law from informing members that such a request was made. The trustee will not pass any information about your present whereabouts to the person making the Request for Information.

If you become eligible for a benefit under the Policy, Life Insurance and TPD Insurance benefits will be paid as a lump sum, Income Protection Insurance benefits will be paid by income stream. A benefit payment will not be made under the Policy until the Trustee has determined to whom the benefit must be paid. This might be you, your beneficiary, your legal personal representative or one or more of your dependants.

child of the member of any age (including adopted · child, stepchild and ex-nuptial child);
the member's legal personal representative; ·
any person who was financially dependent on the · member at the time of death; and

Other than death benefits, a superannuation benefit can only be paid where the member meets a condition of release under SIS. Generally, these circumstances include permanent incapacity, temporary incapacity, terminal medical condition, retirement (or the person has reached their preservation age), the termination of employment after age 60, leaving Australia after holding an eligible temporary resident visa, and on financial hardship or compassionate grounds. Rules relating to when superannuation benefits can be accessed are complex, so you should consult your financial adviser for further information.
Please note that not all the above conditions are relevant to your membership in TAL Super. You will only receive a benefit from TAL Super for one of the following conditions of release:
death; ·
permanent incapacity; ·
temporary incapacity; or ·

Understanding who receives your superannuation and insurance benefit in the event of your death is important. Under the Trust Deed, the Trustee has the discretion to determine to whom and in what proportions any death benefit is payable (see below for binding nominations). You may nominate your legal personal representative and/or dependants as your preferred beneficiaries and the Trustee will consider your wishes in the event of your death.
In the event of your death, benefits will be paid to one or more of your dependants or to your legal personal representative as determined by the Trustee.
For superannuation and tax purposes, the definition of 'dependant' includes any of the following:

A spouse, which includes a person (whether of the · same or different sex) with whom the member is in a relationship that is registered under a law of a State or territory, or a person who, although not legally married to the member, lives with the member on a genuine basis in a relationship as a couple;
A child of the member, including adopted child, · stepchild, ex-nuptial child or child of the member's spouse (but for tax purposes a child must be under age 18);
A person who is financially dependent on the · member; or
A person with whom the member has an · 'interdependency relationship'.

one or each of them provides the other with financial · support; and
one or each of them provides the other with · domestic support and personal care.
An interdependency relationship can also exist where there is a close personal relationship between two people who do not satisfy all other criteria for interdependency because either or both of them suffer from a physical, intellectual, psychiatric or other disability.

Generally, your nomination is only a guide. The Trustee is obliged to pay your death benefit in accordance with the Trust Deed and superannuation laws. If you wish to make your nomination binding, the Trust Deed and superannuation laws require special conditions to be met.
When making (or amending) a binding nomination, the nomination must be signed in the presence of two witnesses. Both witnesses need to be over the age of 18 and cannot be beneficiaries under the binding nomination.
Each binding nomination remains valid for only three years. If you choose this option, it is your responsibility to renew your nomination and advise the Trustee of appropriate changes.
If your nomination expires or is invalid at the time of your death, the Trustee has the discretion to determine to whom and in what proportions any death benefit is payable.

The Trustee is required by superannuation law to transfer your benefits in certain circumstances. The Trustee will transfer your benefits to the ATO (after providing you prior written notice of its intention to do so) if you do not inform the Trustee of an alternative superannuation arrangement within the time frame set out in the notice.
If we pay your benefit to the ATO, you cease to be a member of TAL Super. On transfer to the ATO, your insurance protection in TAL Super ceases. You can transfer or withdraw your benefit from the ATO as the governing legislation permits.

The cost of insurance is referred to as the premium and is determined by TAL. The cost of your Policy depends on a range of factors, including but not limited to the type of cover, your age and gender, whether or not you smoke, the length of time you have had your Policy and how often you choose to pay your premiums. We may also take your occupation, health, income, personal pastimes, lifestyle and other factors into account in determining insurance premium amounts.
We ask for this information so that the premiums we charge take into account the different levels of risk presented by different customer groups. Sometimes discounts may apply to certain Plans; however, these may not apply for the full term of your Policy.
Once we know a little bit about you and the cover you require, we can provide you with an indicative quote for your premium. The quoted premium may change once we have all the information we require to complete our Underwriting assessment.
All premiums (monthly, half-yearly, quarterly and annually) are payable in advance, by the due date shown in your Policy Schedule. We will inform you of the premium payable in subsequent years before each Policy anniversary.

The cost of your cover is not guaranteed to remain the same each year. It can change for both stepped and level premium cover. In the past we have changed the premium rates used to calculate the cost of cover and Policy fees, including changing the premium rates we use to determine level premiums.
We can change our Policy fees or the premium rates we use to determine your premium. If we do this, the cost of your cover will change. However, the premium rates we use to determine your premiums are guaranteed not to change before the first Policy anniversary.
Decisions to change premium rates or Policy fees do not occur because of changes to an individual customer's own circumstances, but rather are determined in relation to the group of customers that we insure.
We will act reasonably when making decisions to change our premium rates or Policy fees and will only make changes to the extent reasonably necessary to protect our legitimate business interests.
Our premiums and Policy fees are determined so that the total premium and Policy fees for our group of insured customers is sufficient to cover our expected future claims costs, meeting our associated costs of doing business and margins in providing cover to you.

We review associated factors on an ongoing basis which may include, but are by no means limited to, our assessment of regulatory or legislative requirements, our operating costs or the commercial environment. These are only some examples of factors that we may consider, and others may apply. The outcome of any premium review performed by us may result in a change to the premium rates and Policy fees we charge you. If we change the premium rates or Policy fees, you will be advised of the change to your premiums or Policy fees at least 30 days before the change takes effect.
If your premiums increase, you will always have the option to reduce the premium by reducing your cover, subject to any minimum premiums or sum insured applicable to your Policy.
You will also always have the right to cancel your cover, at any time and for any reason, including a premium increase.  There may be other options available to help you manage the cost of your cover. Please speak to your adviser for assistance.
Your Policy cannot be singled out for a change in how premium is charged because of an adverse change in the health or circumstances of the Life Insured after the Policy start date.

If the premium is not received by the due date, you will be sent a notice and provided at least 30 days to pay the overdue premium. If we do not receive the overdue premium by the date stated in the notice, your Policy will be cancelled.

Unless otherwise stated, the general information provided below is based on Australian law that is in force at the time this document was prepared and relates to Australian resident individuals only.
We recommend that you obtain independent, professional tax advice that takes into account your specific circumstances regarding the tax and superannuation implications of investing in or contributing to superannuation and of joining and obtaining insurance cover through TAL Super.
The complexity of taxation laws and rulings is such that any advice should be specific to your circumstances. This should include any tax implications of purchasing insurance cover structured through superannuation or outside of superannuation.
A benefit payment will not be made under a Policy through TAL Super until the Trustee has determined to whom the benefit must be paid. This might be you, your beneficiary, your legal personal representative or one or more of your dependants. Except for benefits paid under Income Protection, benefits paid from TAL Super are treated as superannuation benefits for tax purposes. Where TAL or the Trustee is required by law to withhold any tax from a benefit, TAL or the Trustee will withhold the required amount before paying the benefit.

Individuals have different options to contribute to superannuation to fund the acquisition of insurance cover. Below is a general summary of the Australian tax implications of making contributions to a complying superannuation fund and receiving the types of benefits that are insured under Accelerated Protection.  Please visit www.ato.gov.au for more information about contributions and work test requirements.

You can make concessional or non-concessional superannuation contributions to a complying superannuation fund. Non-concessional contributions include contributions for which you do not claim an income tax deduction and any excess concessional contributions that are not refunded by the fund.
Concessional contributions include personal contributions which are claimed as a tax deduction, employer contributions and salary sacrifice contributions.
Concessional contributions are generally included in the fund's assessable income and may be subject to tax at the rate of 15% in the fund's hands. Additional taxes may be imposed on a member with a high adjusted taxable income above $250,000 that receives concessional contributions.
There are caps on the amount you can contribute to your superannuation each financial year to be taxed at lower rates, one for concessional contributions and another one that applies to non-concessional contributions. These caps exist to limit the amount that you can contribute to your superannuation each financial year and still receive concessional tax treatment. If your contributions exceed these caps, you may have to pay extra tax.

If you receive an excess concessional or nonconcessional contribution determination from the ATO, you should not elect for amounts to be released from TAL Super. TAL Super is unable to process a release authority from the ATO because you will not have an accumulation interest in TAL Super. In these circumstances if you require an amount to be released, you should nominate another superannuation fund in which you have a sufficient account balance to make the release from.
Depending on your income you may also benefit from government co-contributions if you make a non-concessional contribution to your superannuation. The government co-contribution is a payment made by the Federal Government to the superannuation account of eligible members who make non-concessional contributions.
For more information about contributions, including the caps that apply each year and how contributions are counted towards the caps, as well as how government co-contributions work, please contact your financial adviser or go to www.ato.gov.au .
