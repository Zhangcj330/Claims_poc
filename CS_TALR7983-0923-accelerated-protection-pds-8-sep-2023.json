    "content": "1.2.2 Plan structure\n\nThere are several different ways you can structure your Plans. An adviser can help you decide which Plan structure is suitable for your needs. The Plans structures available are:\n\n• Standalone: A claim paid under a Standalone Plan will not reduce the Benefit Amount of another Standalone Plan. • Attached/Attaching: When a Plan is Attached to another Plan, a claim paid under a Plan will reduce the Benefit Amount on all other Plans that it is Attached to. All Attached Plans have the same Policy Owner(s) and are issued under one Policy.\n\n• Linked/Linking: When a Plan is Linked to another Plan, a claim paid under a Plan will reduce the Benefit Amount on all other Plans that it is Linked to. Linked Plans have different Policy Owners and the Plans are issued under multiple policies. This allows you to package Plans that cannot be structured through superannuation with Plans that are structured through superannuation.\n\n• Superlink: Two policies are issued, one structured through superannuation and the other outside of superannuation. The Benefit Amount for both policies must be the same and the maximum benefit payable is the equivalent to the Benefit Amount of one Policy. This allows a portion of the premium to be funded through superannuation, thereby reducing out-of-pocket cost while still providing access to benefits that are not available when insurance is structured through superannuation.\n\nIf you make a claim and Superlink applies, we will assess the claim against the Policy structured through superannuation first. If a benefit is payable and the SIS legislation and rules are met, we will pay the benefits from the Policy structured through superannuation. If a benefit is payable but the SIS legislation and rules are not met, we will pay the benefits from the Policy structured outside superannuation.\n\n27 Contents Page\n\nNext Section\n\nC1)\n\nIntroducing Accelerated Protection continued"

Please see Sections 1.3.2 and 1.3.3 below for more information.\n\nLevel premium\n\nLevel premiums are not fixed. They can change. If you choose level premiums, the premium is based on your age at the Plan start date. Where you choose to increase your cover or the Inflation Protection Benefit applies, the premium rates used to calculate premiums for the increased portion will be based on the Life Insured’s age at that time.

If you wish to make a claim against the Policy, we strongly encourage you to contact us at the earliest possible opportunity. If you don’t tell us about the Life Insured’s Sickness or Injury when it happens, and this affects our ability to gather evidence that we require to assess your claim, then this may potentially impact the time that it will take us to assess your claim.\n\nAn event giving rise to a claim must occur when your insurance cover is in force and claim payments can only be made, start to accumulate or continue while your cover is in place.\n\nOur assessment of your claim will involve determining whether your claim meets all relevant Policy terms and conditions and any applicable special condition shown in the Policy Schedule. This includes the terms and conditions that apply to the payment of any benefit under a Plan. It may also include investigating whether the duty to take reasonable care not to make a misrepresentation was complied with when the Policy or Plan was applied for, reinstated or changed. Our assessment of your claim will require obtaining the information, such as medical (for example Medicare, Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and private health insurance records), employment, lifestyle, pastime or financial evidence, that we require to make our decision. This may include information that relates to the period prior to the Policy or Plan start date, such as previous medical, employment, lifestyle, pastime or financial history, to determine whether you or the Life Insured took reasonable care not to make a misrepresentation when you applied for, reinstated or changed the Policy or Plan. In all circumstances we must be satisfied of our initial and ongoing liability to pay a benefit. Any information we require must be provided, and participation in the assessment activities we require must be undertaken, for us to assess your claim and before we will pay a benefit."

Any contributions you make to a superannuation fund in order to pay premiums will reduce the amount you may be able to contribute to other superannuation accounts you hold for retirement savings purposes.\n\n• Where you choose to pay premiums by rollover from another superannuation fund, your retirement savings will be reduced so that you may have less available to you on retirement than otherwise may have been the case. You should ensure that the cost of premiums do not inappropriately erode your retirement savings.\n\n• Taxation or superannuation laws may change in the future, altering the suitability of holding insurance through superannuation.\n\n84\n\n9 Definitions"

The Mercer Super Trust is a regulated superannuation fund regulated by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) under the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 (Cth). Mercer pays for the Trustee’s costs of running TAL Super. TAL makes payments to Mercer towards the costs of running TAL Super. These costs are not an additional cost to you.\n\nOnce you are a member of TAL Super and TAL has agreed to issue the cover, the Trustee will be the Policy Owner and you will then be the Life Insured. You will not have an accumulation account in TAL Super, as the Trustee will immediately pay all contributions and rollovers received for you to the Mercer Super Trust (TAL Super) Application Moneys Account to pay your Accelerated Protection insurance premiums. Your membership of TAL Super only provides insurance benefits.\n\nThe Trustee may reduce your contributions if it is able to claim a tax deduction for the premiums funded by that payment and the contributions are not assessable income to the fund. To reflect the most common tax outcome to TAL Super, the Trustee will assume:\n\nTAL Super is governed by the Trust Deed. The Trustee can amend these governing rules at any time if superannuation law permits.\n\nUnder the Trust Deed, the Trustee is not generally liable to you for any act or omission other than where it has failed to act honestly or has intentionally and/or recklessly failed to exercise the degree of due care and diligence that it was required to exercise.\n\nyou will be claiming a tax deduction for any personal"
